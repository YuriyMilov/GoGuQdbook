	<br>
	<br> Come back again soon and see new additions to the site :)
	<br>
	<br> PS: Even though the world did not end, in a way, it kinda
	did.
	<br>
	<br> Just like a person going through life changes, near death
	experiences or revelations; Our world will never be the same again..
	<br>
	<br> Of course major changes take time, and sometimes stretch and
	drag on longer than expected, but we are at a point of no return.
	<br>
	<br> Some folks will argue that nothing has changed, and they
	would be right.
	<br> Others will notice the unreal and unbelieavable side to
	reality, and they would be right too.
	<br>
	<br> But this is not about the end of the world, or the end of the
	world as many of us know it. This is not about the Mayans.
	<br>
	<br> This is about the hidden reality, which so many of us have
	dreamt of and deem to be an unreachable fantasy.
	<br>
	<br> It's real.
	<br>
	<br> Come back another time, when I have added more.... :)
