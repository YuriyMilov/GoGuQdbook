			<td>Website Launch Date 12/21/12<br> <br> The OtherKin
				List<br> <br> Come back again soon and see new additions
				to the site :) <br>
			<br> PS: Even though the world did not end, in a way, it kinda
				did.<br> <br> Just like a person going through life
				changes, near death experiences or revelations; Our world will never
				be the same again..<br> <br> Of course major changes take
				time, and sometimes stretch and drag on longer than expected, but we
				are at a point of no return.<br> <br> Some folks will
				argue that nothing has changed, and they would be right.<br>
				Others will notice the unreal and unbelieavable side to reality, and
				they would be right too.<br> <br> But this is not about
				the end of the world, or the end of the world as many of us know it.
				This is not about the Mayans.<br> <br> This is about the
				hidden reality, which so many of us have dreamt of and deem to be an
				unreachable fantasy.<br> <br> It's real.<br> <br>
				Come back another time, when I have added more.... :)
